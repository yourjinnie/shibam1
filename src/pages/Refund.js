                b. Refund requests must be submitted in writing to our customer
                service department, detailing the reasons for dissatisfaction

                <br />
                c. Refunds will be processed based on the extent of
                dissatisfaction and will be issued within [Y days] of approval.
                <br />
                d. Any refunds processed will be credited back to the original
                payment method used for the service.
